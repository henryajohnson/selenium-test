# selenium-test
Made a selenium test in java on mac to open up a form in a webpage using Firefox, Chrome and Safari browser as well as the HTML Unit web driver, run either the given inputs in the file or inputs from a csv file, take screenshots of the resulting page after submitting (either error or success), and place them into corresponding folders.
